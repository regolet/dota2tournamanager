## üöÄ Installation & Setup Guide (for a New Server)

### 1. **Invite the Bot to Your Server**
- Use the invite link above, or generate your own from the [Discord Developer Portal](https://discord.com/developers/applications).
- Make sure to select:
  - `bot` and `applications.commands` scopes
  - Permissions: **Administrator** (all permissions)

### 2. **Register and Reflect Slash Commands**
- **After making any changes to your commands or adding new ones, always run:**
  ```bash
  node deploy-commands.js
  node discord-bot/index.js
  ```
- This will register your slash commands with Discord and start the bot so the commands appear in your server.

### 3. **Clone and Install the Bot**
```bash
# Clone the repository
https://github.com/regolet/dota2tournamanager.git
cd dota2tournamanager/discord-bot

# Install dependencies
npm install
```

### 4. **Configure Environment Variables**
- Create a `.env` file in the `discord-bot` directory:
```
DISCORD_TOKEN=your-bot-token-here
WEBAPP_URL=https://your-webapp-url
```
- Replace with your actual bot token and webapp URL.

### 5. **Run the Bot**
```bash
node index.js
```
- The bot should now be online in your server.

### 6. **Automated Server Setup**
- As an admin, run the `/setup_bot` command in your server.
  - This will automatically:
    - Create all required tournament channels (including `tournament-results`)
    - Organize them under a "Tournament" category
    - Set up permissions (admins can post, everyone can view, commands is admin-only)
    - Save channel IDs for your server
- You will see a summary of all actions taken.

### 7. **Ready to Use!**

## üí° Tips
